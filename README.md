# Time-Server-and-Client-UDP

Time server and client system using User Datagram Protocol (UDP), developed by myself as my first computer networking project.

The system enables the client to make various Queries such as to ask the server for the current time, date, year, time since epoch, and more. The client can also measure the average RTT and the average queuing, process, and transmission delay.
